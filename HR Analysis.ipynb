    "The HR data analysis project aims to identify patterns and reasons for employee absenteeism within an organization. This project uses data obtained from Explore Data science Academy for project purposes which includes employee records, time and attendance logs, and performance evaluations, to analyze the causes and effects of absenteeism.\n",

    "\n",
    "Power BI Data visualization tool was used to create interactive dashboards and reports on identified trends, patterns to communicate insights to stakeholders and decision-makers.\n",

    "Ultimately, the project aims to provide actionable insights that can be used to improve employee engagement, reduce absenteeism rates, and increase productivity within the organization. The findings and recommendations from this project will inform HR policies and practices and can be used to make data-driven decisions for the betterment of the organization.\n",

    "The project begins with a thorough data cleaning and preparation process to ensure the data is accurate and reliable. \n",

    "> In this project you are tasked to model the shortfall between the energy generated by means of fossil fuels and various renewable sources - for the country of Spain. The daily shortfall, which will be referred to as the target variable, will be modelled as a function of various city-specific weather features such as `pressure`, `wind speed`, `humidity`, etc. As with all data science projects, the provided features are rarely adequate predictors of the target variable. As such, you are required to perform feature engineering to ensure that you will be able to accurately model Spain's three hourly shortfalls.\n",
